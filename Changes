Revision history for Perl extension Apache::SSI.

2.13  Sun Jun  4 01:34:36 EDT 2000
   Since HTML::SimpleParse now handles case-sensitivity correctly, we
   need to be a bit more careful in this module.  If you're using
   HTML::SimpleParse version 0.09 or greater, you'll need this here
   version (1.13) of Apache::SSI or greater if you want SSI to work.

   Improved the error message you get when there's no 'file' or 'virtual'
   attribute of an <!--#include--> tag.


2.12  Mon May 15 18:50:37 EDT 2000
   Don't force content_type to be 'text/html'.  Let the server admin
   decide that in the httpd.conf file.  [danmcc@metro.net (Dan McCormick)]

   Get the port, user, group, and path to httpd from the user at 'perl
   Makefile.PL' time.  This stuff is used during the 'make test' step.
   This module should now behave like Apache::Filter and
   Apache::AuthCookie with respect to those 4 parameters at test time.

2.11  Sun Feb 20 12:03:38 EST 2000
   - Fixed a bug in which $/ was being set to undef in Perl code called by
     <!--#perl--> directives (wald@library.ho.lucent.com (Robert Waldstein)).

   - To keep compatibility with mod_include, allow <!--#perl sub=Pack--> as
     an abbreviation for <!--#perl sub=Pack::handler-->
     (wald@library.ho.lucent.com (Robert Waldstein)).

   - Made a note in the documentation that calling subroutines by name is
     usually quite a bit faster than using anonymous subrefs.

2.10  Sun Dec 12 14:32:02 EST 1999
   - The handler() routine will now respect HEAD requests and not send
     the entire document in such cases.  Thanks to Kevin Murphy.

2.09  Nov 28 21:55
   - Added support for the 'timefmt' config directive for formatting
     time-related output (thanks to Vassilii Khachaturov for the idea
     & implementation).

2.08  Aug 28 01:29
   - Forgot to include a couple of files in the distribution - they
     were files used during the 'make test' phase of installation.  No
     effect on functionality here. (Thanks to Tony Cox for the spot)

2.07  Aug 10 17:39
   - Now requires HTML::SimpleParse 0.06, which fixes a bug in
     backslash-escaping of HTML key-value pairs.

   - Markus Schuh showed me how to fix the warning (line "85") that I
     introduced in 2.06.  Thanks!

   - For <!--#exec --> stuff, we now check OPT_INCNOEXEC instead of
     OPT_EXECCGI.

2.06_1  Wed Feb  3 11:31:52 EST 1999
   - Forgot to include some 'make test' files in the MANIFEST, so they
     didn't get distributed.  No changes to the code here.

2.06  Wed Feb  3 00:16:12 EST 1999
   - The boolean expressions of the <!--#if--> and <!--#elsif--> directives
     are now handled with a Perl eval().  This allows proper parsing of
     expressions like "!($var)", and even lets you use pre-loaded Perl
     subroutines in those expressions.  The specific mechanism I'm using to
     fill in the variables is quite voodooey, I'd appreciate some feedback
     on how it's working.

   - Sometime in the last few versions I introduced a new "Use of
     uninitialized value at blib/lib/Apache/SSI.pm line 85" warning, but I
     can't for the life of me figure out what's uninitialized.  Anyone?
     That line is:
        if ($ssi =~ m/^<!--#(.*)-->$/s) {
     Through my testing, I know $ssi is defined, and that's definitely the
     line it's complaining about.

   - The arg, args, & pass_request parameters to <!--#perl ...--> are now
     processed case-insensitively.
 
   - <!--#perl sub="Named::Subroutine"--> had been broken, probably from day
     one.  Now it's fixed.

2.05  Mon Feb  1 12:12:25 EST 1999
   - Fixed a bug that was preventing directives from spanning multiple lines
     [ Thanks, Yury Kuznesov ]

2.04  Sat Jan 30 00:27:54 EST 1999
   - Removed the %ENV = $r->cgi_env line, since it's not necessary.
     See http://forum.swarthmore.edu/epigone/modperl/jangblorkand .

   - Added "local $/ = undef;" line to reading input filehandle, which
     should speed up running under Apache::Filter. [Thanks, Joshua Chamos]

   - Added support for <!--#exec cgi="..."-->.  Please let me know
     if there are any problems, there are a lot of things to get right
     (or go wrong).  Thanks to Yury Kuznesov for the urging.

   - Added support for <!--#config ...-->, except the 'timefmt' directive.
     
   - With the small exception in 'config' above, I think that now all the 
     functionality of mod_include is present in Apache::SSI.  Once people have 
     used it for a while and we've ironed out bugs, I'll declare some version 
     "officially stable and complete" or something.

2.03  Mon Jan  4 04:43:01 EST 1999
   - Added support for the #if, #elif, #else, and #endif directives

   - Failed includes now report in the error log the name of the file they
     were trying to include.

2.02  Fri Nov 27 04:25:00 EST 1998
   - Added minimal and probably buggy support for variable interpolation in
     SSI directives.

   - <!--#fsize ...--> should work now.

2.01 Wed Nov 11 18:31:12 EST 1998
   - Backed out the $r->finfo change from 1.99 because of some reported
     problems with it.

2.00 (not formally released, because I forgot to add to the Changes file)

1.99  Mon, 09 Nov 1998 07:45:47 GMT
   - Uses $r->finfo for doing file-test operations, instead of using $r->filename.
     Supposedly this speeds things up by avoiding an expensive system call (I
     haven't benchmarked it).  See 
     http://www.modperl.com/chapters/ch8.html#Client_Request_Methods

   - Checks the return status of the call to $r->filter_input.  If you're
     using Apache::SSI with Apache::Filter, you'll need to upgrade
     Apache::Filter to version 0.02 to use this version of Apache::SSI.

1.98  Sat Nov  7 02:19:05 EST 1998
   - Will now cooperate with Apache::Filter if you've got it.

   - Strips backslashes used in perl subs like these:
     <!--#perl sub="sub {for (0..10) {print \"very \"}}"-->
     [thanks, Stephane Bortzmeyer]

   - More verbose error logging when you turn on the debug flags
     [ibid]

   - When reading the input file (and not using Apache::Filter), we use
     a lexical variable for the filehandle, instead of the local(*IN)
     we were using before.

   - Compensates for changes in the rotation of the Earth after Jesse Ventura
     is elected governor of my state.

1.97  Thu Oct 22 02:43:34 EDT 1998
   - Fixed DOCUMENT_NAME, DOCUMENT_URI, and LAST_MODIFIED so they return information
     about the document the user requested, not the document we're currently
     processing (which might be an <!--#include-->'d file).  Test 7 in real.t
     witnesses the change.  
     This behavior is consistent with mod_include, and I think it's also desirable:
     the browser shouldn't see the names of documents we're including.
     [thanks, Bruce Hoylman]
     
   - Now the three above ENV variables cache their results in the subprocess_env
     table, which will speed things up if you call them repeatedly.  This is similar
     to mod_include, but mod_include puts them there at the _beginning_ of the 
     request, whereas I wait until they're asked for.
     

1.96  Fri Oct 16 20:10:54 EDT 1998
   - Added a text() method for getting/setting the contents of the HTML.
     This fixes a bug when used with Apache::SSIChain.  
     [thanks, John Armstrong]

1.95  Sun Oct 11 16:04:19 EDT 1998

   - Doesn't rely on HTML::SimpleParse anymore to parse the HTML, but instead just
     looks for <!--#.*?-->.  This allows nesting: <img src="<!--#whatever-->">,
     and it should be much faster.  HTML::SimpleParse is still used to parse 
     the key-value pairs of attributes for SSI directives. 
     [Randal Schwartz, Rob Hartill]
     
   - <!--#flastmod virtual="whatever"--> now works. [Rob Hartill]
     
   - <!--#perl --> sections now pass $r as the first argument, and there
     are two ways to turn off this behavior (PerlSetVar and named parameter).
     [Ibid]
     
   - You can mix & match the "arg" and "args" parameters to <!--#perl--> 
     sections, like so:
      <!--#perl sub=something arg="Hi, Ken" args=5,12,13 arg="Bye, Ken"-->
      &main::something($r, "Hi, Ken", "5", "12", "13", "Bye, Ken");
     
   - Added prototypes to several methods, which might conceivably speed them
     up if the compiler can optimize around it.
     
   - In ssi_set, removed workaround for mod_perl 1.12 bug.
     

1.94  Wed Oct  7 19:57:03 EDT 1998
   - Apache::SSI can now be subclassed much more easily under mod_perl,
     because it knows how to deal with PERL_METHOD_HANDLERS=1 scenarios.
     See the docs' SUMMARY for more info.
   - The tests have been moved into the t/ directory, and there's a new
     real.t test that will start an apache server and fetch a few pages.

1.93  Wed Sep 23 15:53:21 EDT 1998
   - You can now pass multiple arguments to a <!--#perl--> routine.

1.92  Sat Sep 19 01:55:50 EDT 1998
   - Added a "return;" statement to the ssi_include routine.  Avoids printing
     an extraneous "1" in the served page.  Don't know how I missed this
     before.  Thanks to Gil Vidals.

1.91  Sun Jun 28 17:49:29 EDT 1998
   - In README and Makefile.PL, I've noted that mod_perl must be installed
     before this module will work.
   
   - I've updated everything so that it can use HTML::SimpleParse version 0.03,
     which requires that each output_* function return its output rather than
     print it.

1.90  Fri Jun 26 18:07:57 1998
   - original version; created by h2xs 1.18.  Actually a re-write of Doug
     MacEachern's original version.

mod_include has this:
     if (!(allow_options(r) & OPT_INCLUDES)) {
        return DECLINED;
    }
