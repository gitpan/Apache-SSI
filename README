Hi,

This is the Apache::SSI module.  

Apache::SSI implements the functionality of mod_include for handling
server-parsed html documents.  In my mind, there are two main reasons one
might want to use it: you can sub-class it to implement your own custom SSI
directives, and/or you can use an OutputChain to get the SSI output first,
then send it through another PerlHandler.

For more specific information, please see the documentation inside SSI.pm,
by doing "pod2txt SSI.pm", or "perldoc Apache::SSI" once you've installed
the module.

To install the module, do the usual:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
