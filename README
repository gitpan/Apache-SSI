Hi,

This is the Apache::SSI module.  

Apache::SSI implements the functionality of mod_include for handling
server-parsed html documents.  It is meant to run under Apache's mod_perl.  

In my mind, there are two main reasons one might want to use this module:
you can sub-class it to implement your own custom SSI directives, and/or you
can use an OutputChain to get the SSI output first, then send it through
another PerlHandler.

For more specific information, please see the documentation inside SSI.pm,
by doing "pod2txt SSI.pm", or "perldoc Apache::SSI" once you've installed
the module.

To install the module:

   <make sure mod_perl and HTML::SimpleParse.pm are installed>
   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Note that mod_perl and HTML::SimpleParse must already be installed before
you install this module.  When you do "perl Makefile.PL", you'll be notified
if you don't have one or the other (for mod_perl, I check whether
Apache::Constants.pm is present).
