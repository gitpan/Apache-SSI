Revision history for Perl extension Apache::SSI.

1.94  Wed Oct  7 19:57:03 EDT 1998
   - Apache::SSI can now be subclassed much more easily under mod_perl,
     because it knows how to deal with PERL_METHOD_HANDLERS=1 scenarios.
     See the docs' SUMMARY for more info.
   - The tests have been moved into the t/ directory, and there's a new
     real.t test that will start an apache server and fetch a few pages.

1.93  Wed Sep 23 15:53:21 EDT 1998
   - You can now pass multiple arguments to a <!--#perl--> routine.

1.92  Sat Sep 19 01:55:50 EDT 1998
   - Added a "return;" statement to the ssi_include routine.  Avoids printing
     an extraneous "1" in the served page.  Don't know how I missed this
     before.  Thanks to Gil Vidals.

1.91  Sun Jun 28 17:49:29 EDT 1998
   - In README and Makefile.PL, I've noted that mod_perl must be installed
	  before this module will work.
	
	- I've updated everything so that it can use HTML::SimpleParse version 0.03,
	  which requires that each output_* function return its output rather than
	  print it.

1.90  Fri Jun 26 18:07:57 1998
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.18.  Actually a re-write of Doug
	  MacEachern's original version.

mod_include has this:
     if (!(allow_options(r) & OPT_INCLUDES)) {
        return DECLINED;
    }
