Revision history for Perl extension Apache::SSI.

1.99
   - Uses $r->finfo for doing file-test operations, instead of using $r->filename.
     Supposedly this speeds things up by avoiding an expensive system call (I
     haven't benchmarked it).  See 
     http://www.modperl.com/chapters/ch8.html#Client_Request_Methods

1.98  Sat Nov  7 02:19:05 EST 1998
   - Will now cooperate with Apache::Filter if you've got it.

   - Strips backslashes used in perl subs like these:
     <!--#perl sub="sub {for (0..10) {print \"very \"}}"-->
     [thanks, Stephane Bortzmeyer]

   - More verbose error logging when you turn on the debug flags
     [ibid]

   - When reading the input file (and not using Apache::Filter), we use
     a lexical variable for the filehandle, instead of the local(*IN)
     we were using before.

   - Compensates for changes in the rotation of the Earth after Jesse Ventura
     is elected governor of my state.

1.97  Thu Oct 22 02:43:34 EDT 1998
   - Fixed DOCUMENT_NAME, DOCUMENT_URI, and LAST_MODIFIED so they return information
     about the document the user requested, not the document we're currently
     processing (which might be an <!--#include-->'d file).  Test 7 in real.t
     witnesses the change.  
     This behavior is consistent with mod_include, and I think it's also desirable:
     the browser shouldn't see the names of documents we're including.
     [thanks, Bruce Hoylman]
     
   - Now the three above ENV variables cache their results in the subprocess_env
     table, which will speed things up if you call them repeatedly.  This is similar
     to mod_include, but mod_include puts them there at the _beginning_ of the 
     request, whereas I wait until they're asked for.
     

1.96  Fri Oct 16 20:10:54 EDT 1998
   - Added a text() method for getting/setting the contents of the HTML.
     This fixes a bug when used with Apache::SSIChain.  
     [thanks, John Armstrong]

1.95  Sun Oct 11 16:04:19 EDT 1998

   - Doesn't rely on HTML::SimpleParse anymore to parse the HTML, but instead just
     looks for <!--#.*?-->.  This allows nesting: <img src="<!--#whatever-->">,
     and it should be much faster.  HTML::SimpleParse is still used to parse 
     the key-value pairs of attributes for SSI directives. 
     [Randal Schwartz, Rob Hartill]
     
   - <!--#flastmod virtual="whatever"--> now works. [Rob Hartill]
     
   - <!--#perl --> sections now pass $r as the first argument, and there
     are two ways to turn off this behavior (PerlSetVar and named parameter).
     [Ibid]
     
   - You can mix & match the "arg" and "args" parameters to <!--#perl--> 
     sections, like so:
      <!--#perl sub=something arg="Hi, Ken" args=5,12,13 arg="Bye, Ken"-->
      &main::something($r, "Hi, Ken", "5", "12", "13", "Bye, Ken");
     
   - Added prototypes to several methods, which might conceivably speed them
     up if the compiler can optimize around it.
     
   - In ssi_set, removed workaround for mod_perl 1.12 bug.
     

1.94  Wed Oct  7 19:57:03 EDT 1998
   - Apache::SSI can now be subclassed much more easily under mod_perl,
     because it knows how to deal with PERL_METHOD_HANDLERS=1 scenarios.
     See the docs' SUMMARY for more info.
   - The tests have been moved into the t/ directory, and there's a new
     real.t test that will start an apache server and fetch a few pages.

1.93  Wed Sep 23 15:53:21 EDT 1998
   - You can now pass multiple arguments to a <!--#perl--> routine.

1.92  Sat Sep 19 01:55:50 EDT 1998
   - Added a "return;" statement to the ssi_include routine.  Avoids printing
     an extraneous "1" in the served page.  Don't know how I missed this
     before.  Thanks to Gil Vidals.

1.91  Sun Jun 28 17:49:29 EDT 1998
   - In README and Makefile.PL, I've noted that mod_perl must be installed
	  before this module will work.
	
	- I've updated everything so that it can use HTML::SimpleParse version 0.03,
	  which requires that each output_* function return its output rather than
	  print it.

1.90  Fri Jun 26 18:07:57 1998
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.18.  Actually a re-write of Doug
	  MacEachern's original version.

mod_include has this:
     if (!(allow_options(r) & OPT_INCLUDES)) {
        return DECLINED;
    }
